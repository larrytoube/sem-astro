## Introduction

Leopard and Roses, a distinctive lifestyle and hospitality brand, sought to redefine its digital presence to better connect with a younger, more design-conscious audience. With a strong physical experience but an outdated online identity, the brand was missing opportunities to attract millennial travelers who discover and book experiences through social media and digital channels.

## Challenges

The brand's existing digital presence did not reflect the vibrant, eclectic character that made Leopard and Roses unique in person. Their website lacked modern design sensibilities, social media content was inconsistent, and there was no cohesive visual language tying the brand together across platforms. Additionally, the competitive landscape in lifestyle hospitality was intensifying, with newer brands leveraging strong digital-first strategies to capture the millennial market.

## Solutions

Sharp End Marketing developed a comprehensive creative strategy to transform Leopard and Roses' digital presence from the ground up.

**Brand Identity Refresh:** We crafted a modern, visually striking brand identity that captured the bold, eclectic spirit of Leopard and Roses. The new visual system included an updated colour palette, typography, and photography style that resonated with millennial aesthetics while staying true to the brand's unique personality.

**Social Media Strategy:** A dynamic social media strategy was implemented across Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, with content pillars focused on behind-the-scenes stories, guest experiences, and curated lifestyle content. Each platform received tailored content that leveraged its unique strengths — visual storytelling on Instagram, community building on Facebook, and inspiration boards on Pinterest.

**Content Creation:** Professional photography and video content was produced to showcase the spaces, experiences, and atmosphere that made Leopard and Roses special. User-generated content was encouraged through branded hashtags and guest spotlight features.

**Targeted Campaigns:** Paid social campaigns were designed to reach millennial travelers in key markets, using interest-based and lookalike audience targeting to maximize reach and engagement.

## Project Results

The transformation of Leopard and Roses' digital presence delivered measurable results. Bookings from millennial travelers increased by 25%, driven primarily by social media discovery and engagement. Instagram followers grew by 180%, with engagement rates consistently outperforming industry benchmarks. The cohesive new brand identity received positive feedback from both existing customers and new audiences, establishing Leopard and Roses as a must-visit destination for design-conscious travelers.

The refreshed digital presence gave Leopard and Roses a strong foundation for continued growth, with a scalable content system and brand guidelines that ensured consistency across all future touchpoints.
