      <p class="mt-6 text-body-lg leading-relaxed text-text-body">
        We are your outsourced marketing department. If you do all the calculations, it's probably cheaper to contract out to us than have a part-time or full-time in-house employee.

      <p class="mt-4 text-body-lg leading-relaxed text-text-body">
        Content is KING. If you develop the right content that is relevant, engaging and dare we say entertaining to your prospective and existing customers, your company will reap rewards for a long time to come.
