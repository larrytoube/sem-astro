        SmartyPantz Escape Rooms was the first escape room experience provider in Gastown, located in the heart of Vancouver. As pioneers in the local escape room market, they needed a brand positioning strategy that would cement their first-mover advantage and establish them as the go-to destination for immersive entertainment in the city.

        As the escape room industry grew rapidly in Vancouver, SmartyPantz faced the challenge of standing out in an increasingly competitive market. New competitors were entering the space regularly, and the brand needed to differentiate itself beyond simply being "the first." They needed a strategy that would communicate their unique value proposition and keep them top-of-mind with both locals and tourists visiting Gastown.
